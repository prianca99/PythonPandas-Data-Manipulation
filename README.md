The Script 'FileWrite.py' does the following:

1. Write the data of three tables (table1,2,3) into one Macro-Enabled worksheet.
2. This Macro-enabled worksheet has the pivot sheet with all the underlying data.
3. An empty .xslm file is encoded to vbaextract.py which contains macros named 'newm'.
4. This vbaextract.py makes vba.Project.bin. You can find more here
